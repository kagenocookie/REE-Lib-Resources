# REE Lib Resources
Repository for storing all up to date data required for REE-Lib features. Intended to be used as an automated way of downloading and updating the individual tooling dependency resource files.

The `resource-info.json` file contains the current status and direct file download URLs, as well as some other potentially useful file paths for editors.

If you'd rather update the resource yourself, you can clone the repository and launch the `setup-local-repository.bat` file. This will create a `local-resource-info.json` file and replace URLs with absolute paths for your local machine.
