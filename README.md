# REE Lib Resources
Repository for storing all up to date data required for REE-Lib features. Intended to be used as an automated way of downloading and updating the individual tooling dependency resource files.

The `resource-info.json` file contains the current status and direct file download URLs, as well as some other potentially useful file paths for editors.

## Credits
